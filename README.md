# üè° House Price Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features of residential properties. It utilizes structured data such as dwelling type, neighborhood, area size, overall quality, and more. The project follows a complete data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and generating predictions for submission.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains various attributes related to houses, such as:

- **Structural features** (e.g., `MSSubClass`, `HouseStyle`, `OverallQual`, `YearBuilt`)
- **Neighborhood characteristics** (`Neighborhood`, `Condition1`, `Condition2`)
- **Lot features** (`LotArea`, `LotShape`, `LandSlope`, `Street`, `Alley`)
- **Basement, Garage, Porch, Pool, and Miscellaneous features**

A full description of each feature is available in the [data_description.txt](./data_description.txt) file.

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing distributions, correlations, and missing data patterns.
   - Visualizations to understand key features' impact on house prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalization/Standardization of numerical variables.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features based on existing attributes.
   - Reducing multicollinearity.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to evaluate performance.
   - Cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

6. **Submission:**
   - Generating a submission file (`submission.csv`) with predicted house prices for the test set.
  
7. **Kaggle.com Competition**
   - The model placed in the top 25% of all the participants in the the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Technique** competition with a score of 0.13017.
